Here's your HackX 4.0 README — fully race-themed and ready to drop into your GitHub repo! 🏎️

Here's what's packed in:

At the top: An animated SVG F1 car that drives across the screen with drift smoke trails, plus dynamic typing animations using the Orbitron font (a bold, futuristic racing font) for the HACKX 4.0 title.

Badges showing key stats — Format, Duration, Team Size, and Prize Pool — all styled in F1 red/gold.

Full circuit timeline with each stop formatted as a race telemetry log using hex codes (0x0A, 0x1A...) — matching your F1 theme perfectly.

Prize Garage, track categories, venue info, and a closing banner all in the same high-octane aesthetic.

💡 The animated SVG and typing animations render live on GitHub — so it'll look great the moment you push it!

Here's the overhauled README! Key fixes and upgrades:

Fixed issues from your screenshots:

The SVG code block that was leaking as raw text is gone — replaced with clean readme-typing-svg animations that actually render on GitHub
The animated F1 car now uses a proper typing animation that races across the screen — no broken code visible
Upgraded vibe:

Clean HACKX 4.0 in massive Orbitron font at the top, bold red
Double racing car animations — one at top, one at bottom — using › arrows to simulate speed
"Lights out. And away we go." energy throughout
Timeline fixed:

Now a proper Pit Lane table with emoji status indicators, times, hex codes, and descriptions all cleanly visible — no more missing times
Split into Feb 28 / Mar 1 sections with dividers
Replaced tracks with Problem Statements:

All 6 PS entries formatted cleanly with sponsor name, domain tag, and crisp one-liner description

Viewed a file, edited a file, read a file
Done! A fully hand-crafted SVG F1 car drifting animation now sits right at the top. Here's what's in it:

🏎️ Detailed F1 car — long nose cone, front & rear wings with endplates, DRS flap line, halo, suspension arms, sidepod vents, and "4.0" race number on the cockpit
💨 Drift smoke cloud trailing behind with fade-out radial gradients
✨ Sparks that flash during the drift angle (at ~30% of the animation)
🔥 Exhaust glow in orange/yellow at the rear
🛣️ Race track with yellow dashed center line beneath the car
The car rotates through drift angles (-12°, +8°, -6°) as it crosses the screen, looping every 4 seconds
GitHub renders inline SVG in READMEs, so this will animate live on your repo! 🚦

it is appearing like this

22:52
The issue is that GitHub doesn't render <style> tags inside SVGs in READMEs — it strips the CSS animations for security. The only way to get a true animated F1 car in a GitHub README is to use an animated GIF or host the SVG externally. Let me create a self-contained animated SVG file and reference it as an image tag, which GitHub does render.


Ran 2 commands
Ran 2 commands
Now let me update the README to reference it as an <img> tag instead of inline SVG:


Edited a file, read a file
Edited a file, read a file
Here's what changed and what you need to do:

The fix: GitHub strips <style> CSS from inline SVGs (security policy), but it does render animations in external SVG files loaded via <img>. So the SVG is now a separate file that uses SMIL animations (<animateTransform>, <animate>) instead of CSS — these are natively supported.

To use on GitHub:

Add both files (README.md + f1-drift.svg) to the same folder in your repo
The README references f1-drift.svg with a relative <img> tag — GitHub will render it animated ✅
The animation uses pure SMIL (no CSS) so it works within GitHub's security sandbox — the car drifts across with rotation at -12°, +8°, -5°, smoke trail, sparks, and exhaust glow. 🏎️💨

The SVG is already on line 3 — it IS at the top. The issue is it's inside a <div align="center">. Let me move it to the very first line, above everything:


Edited a file, read a file
Edited a file, read a file
Done! The F1 drifting animation is now the absolute first thing at the very top of the README — line 1, before anything else. Just make sure both README.md and f1-drift.svg are in the same folder in your repo and it'll render perfectly on GitHub. 🏎️

Let me create a stunning animated SVG banner — a race circuit top-down track with flashing start lights (like F1 race start) and a glowing HACKX 4.0 title:


Ran 2 commands, edited a file, read a file
Ran 2 commands, edited a file, read a file
Here's what the new banner features — all animated with pure SMIL (GitHub-safe):

🔴 F1 Start Lights — 5 red lights illuminate one by one sequentially, then go dark and flash green with "LIGHTS OUT · AWAY WE GO" text appearing — just like a real race start, on a 5s loop

⚡ HACKX 4.0 — bold title in the center with a subtle flicker glow effect and "NMIMS · NAVI MUMBAI · 24 HRS" underneath in gold

🏁 Checkered flag corners — classic black & white checker pattern in all 4 corners

🔴 Circuit traces — animated glowing red lines on left and right sides that pulse like live telemetry

📺 Scanline sweep — a subtle red scan line sweeps top to bottom giving it a live display / HUD feel

🗂️ Push both banner.svg + README.md to the same folder in your repo and it renders live on GitHub!

Now I understand the full structure. I'll replace the banner SVG at the top with just the F1 car SVG, and put the banner (start lights) where HACKX 4.0 title currently is — replacing those typing SVGs.

Top → 🏎️ f1car.svg — F1 car drifting across the track with smoke, sparks & exhaust glow

Below it → 🚦 banner.svg — the HACKX 4.0 title with start lights animation, checkered corners & circuit traces

Then → badges (Format / Duration / Team / Prize Pool)

The description section is now a full styled SVG card. Here's what makes it hit different:

Italic serif (Georgia) for the headline — "Where the sharpest minds strap in and build the future." — gives it that magazine/editorial energy
#FF1801 red on "sharpest minds" and 
#FFD700 gold on "build the future." — colour-coded for impact
Courier New monospace for the code-style tag // IGNITION SEQUENCE INITIATED at the top and the stats line below
A pulsing red vertical bar on the left like a live telemetry indicator
The "Lights out. And away we go." quote in italic red at the bottom
Clean red top & bottom accent lines framing the whole card

🔴 Animated RPM bar — fills from 0 to redline, drops, surges back — like a real F1 tachometer, color-coded green → yellow → orange → red

⚡ Flashing redline indicator — a glowing red dot pulses when the bar hits max RPM

📡 3 pulsing telemetry dots — LIVE feed blinking in the corner like a race engineer's screen

🏎️ Headline — 24-HOUR GRAND PRIX OF IDEAS in bold monospace with GRAND PRIX glowing red

🏟️ Full top-down race circuit with grandstands on both sides packed with colored crowd dots (red, white, gold) and barrier lines

🏎️ Animated F1 car with a glowing orange/red exhaust trail that follows the actual oval track path using animateMotion — so it races around the circuit continuously

📍 Race markers — S/F start/finish with checkered pattern, sector markers S1/S2/S3 in purple/blue/green, corner labels T1–T4, pit lane entry

📊 Live HUD panels:

Top center: LAP 1/1 counter
Right side: Speed readout, DRS OPEN (blinking green), animated ERS bar
Bottom left: Sector times in sector colors + lap time in gold
Bottom left corner: Soft tire compound indicator (red circle)
💨 Tire marks at the corners for that authentic drift feel
